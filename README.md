# Gopher Trade (WIP)

Gopher Trade is a currency conversion API built in Go. References are scattered as links through this README. Hopefully when I'm finished I will create a References section at the end of this document.

## Features

Project (development) and product (API) features:

### Development

* CI (GitHub Actions) - Runs tests, linters and compares generated files on Pull Requests to main (which is a protected branch);
* Lint (golangci-lint) - Enforces style and best practices;
* Makefile - Simplifies running tests, dependencies and application.
* Docker Compose - Runs API and dependencies with no configuration and on any OS/arch
* Load testing - Includes [ddosify load testing tool](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify) configuration.

### API

Gopher Trade allows users to register custom currency rates based on USD, get conversions from and to custom or default (USD, BRL, EUR, ETH, BTC) currencies. In the default currencies case, external APIs ([Exchange Rate](https://exchangerate.host/) and [Crypto Compare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/)) are used.
Two future improvements to this project are:

1. Cache responses from external APIs;
2. Configure fallbacks for when an API is unavailable.

On the `client.http` file in the root of this repository you can find examples of how to use the available endpoints. You can also view and try out available endpoints on Swagger UI. After running the app, access <http://localhost:3000/swagger> (if you ran with default config).

## Testing

This project does not aim to have 100% test coverage. Also, its development did not follow strict TDD doctrine, instead it [aimed to test behaviour](https://dave.cheney.net/paste/absolute-unit-test-london-gophers.pdf).

To run all automated tests (unit and integration):

```bash
make test
```

There is a preconfigured load test tool in the `load_test` directory at the root of this folder. To install and run, just enter

```bash
make load-test
```

in your terminal. The tool is preconfigured to make 1000 requests in 1 second to each available endpoint. To adjust values, check out the [ddosify docs](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify).

**In the current version, load tests result around 80% success rates in the conversion endpoint (`[GET] /currencies/conversion?from={{code}}&to={{code}}&amount={{value}}`), and 100% success in other endpoints. The reason for failures in the conversion endpoints are external API timeouts and free request limits. To solve this issue, a cache will be implemented.

## Running locally

Just enter:

```bash
make api
```

in your terminal and voil√†! It will run an image of a postgres db and the Gopher Trade API on docker containers. To stop you can use:

```bach
make stop
```

And to see the db and app logs:

```bash
make logs
```

## Application Dependencies

This project imports external packages (list does not include development tools installed in some makefile commands):

* [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) - to simplify test assertions;
* [Decimal](https://github.com/shopspring/decimal) - to handle decimal values. See [number types section](#number-types) below;
* [UUID](https://github.com/google/uuid) - to generate unique IDs;
* [Moq](https://github.com/matryer/moq) - to use autogenerated mocks;
* [Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) - to handle migrations;
* [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) - as PostgreSQL driver and toolkit;
* [Dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest) - for integration tests;
* [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) - for routing on http server;
* [go-chi/cors](https://github.com/go-chi/cors) - to configure CORS for browser requests;
* [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) - for autogenerated Swagger docs;
* [http-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/http-swagger) - to serve Swagger UI page.
* [sync*](https://golang.org/x/sync) - to handle goroutines. * Sync is ["part of the Go Project, but outside the main Go tree"](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x).

## Tech Specs

### Architecture

Aiming to make this project more scalable and maintainable, it is being developed based on [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

### Number types

The first idea in this project was to use integer values for monetary values (representing in cents), for simplicity. However, specificities of currency exchange made this a bad alternative, i.e., non-fiat currencies (such as criptocurrencies) and exchange rates being commonly measured and represented with more than 2 decimal points.

Considering the [floating-point arithmetic problem](https://floating-point-gui.de/), the [decimal](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/shopspring/decimal) package was used (initially using the standard lib `math/big` package was considered, but given the scope of the project and the time constraint, using an external lib was considered the best trade-off).

## Workflow

A very basic [Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) was used to keep track of priorities and deadline for the project. It was kept simples since the project is being developed by one person. For this purpose, [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) showed to be enough.

Given the time constraint (deadline and hours available during the day), an [MVP](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/#:~:text=A%20minimum%20viable%20product%2C%20or,iterate%20and%20improve%20the%20product.) was planned, an some improvements indicated in the Backlog.

The [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard was followed during the development of the project. Pull Requests were opened for each feature (although without code review, but for the sake of having a stable main branch - and prettier commit log), mocking a [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development).
